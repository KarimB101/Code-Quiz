# Coding Quiz
challenge 4
## User story 
AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers

## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and my score

## Description
On this webpage you should be able to take a short coding quiz with a starting timer of 1 minute. If you answer a question incorrectly your score will be reduced along with the amount of time
you have available. If you are not able to finish the quiz you will recieve a zero for an incomplete assessment. If you want to view the scores that have been previously recorded you can click the view highscores link which will take you to a list of the scores recorded with the initials. There will be 5 questions to complete in this quiz. Good Luck!
